* **TypeScript**: Ensuring type safety and an enhanced developer experience with intelligent autocompletion and error checking.

## ✨ Features

* **Fundamental UI Components**: A curated set of essential React components to kickstart your projects.
* **Type-Safe Development**: Fully written in TypeScript for robust and predictable code.
<!-- * **Storybook Integration**: Live preview and interactive documentation for all components. -->

## 🚀 Installation

While the package is not yet published, once it is, installation will be straightforward:

```bash
# Using npm

## 💡 Usage
Prismal react native components are designed to be imported individually, allowing for optimal bundle size and clear dependency management.

```jsx
import { Button } from '@prismal/react-native'; // Import specific components

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to Primal React Native!</h1>
      <Button onPress={() => alert('Button clicked!')}>
        Click Me
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```
